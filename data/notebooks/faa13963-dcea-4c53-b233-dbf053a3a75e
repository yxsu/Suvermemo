In New Dehli, on Feb 13, an assailant reportedly affixed a &quot;sticky bomb&quot; to a car carrying the wife of an Israeli diplomat. It detonated near the Israeli embassy, injuring four. On the same day, in Tibbillist, an attempt to blow up an Israeli-embassy vehicle was foiled. The next day, three explosions in Tib injured four and rippled off the leg of an suspected bomber, who Thil police say is Iranian. Officials in the three countries refrained from speculating too much about the attacks before the investigation are completed. But Israeli Prime Minister Na said, &quot;Iran stands behind the bombers&quot;&nbsp;\n</en-note>'

But two analyses show that poor air quality can lead to heart attack or stroke within as little as a few hours after exposure. In one review of research, scientists found that people exposed to high levels of pollutants, including carbon ... fine particulates emitted by cars and manufacturing facilities, were up to 5% more likely to suffer a heart attack within days of exposure than those with lower exposure. An separate study of stroke patients shows that even air that the Environmental Protection Agency considers to be of &quot;moderate&quot; quality and relative safe to our health can boost the risk of stroke as much as 34% within 12 to 14 hours of exposure.</div><div><br/></div><div>While the authors of both studies stress these risks are relative low to healthy people and certainly modest compared with other risk factors such as smoking and high-blood pressure. they are important to recognize because everyone is exposed to air pollution regardless of lifestyle choices. So stricter regulation by the EPA of pollutants may not only improve environmental air quality but could also become necessary to protect public health.</div></en-note>'

Perhaps that&apos;s why business school and leadership coach have been talking in recent month about what management lesson should be taken from I&apos;s biography of Steve Jobs, which provides an anthropological look at the habits of most famous CEO since GE&apos;s &quot;Neutron Jack&quot; Welch. In it, Jobs is revealed as both an autocratic bully and a business genius who executed the most successful corporation turnaround so far this century.</div><div><br/></div><div>Perhaps this book should be required reading for MBAs, since the management arts associated with Jobs&apos; story are not what you might think. Business school often asked me what Steve Jobs teach us about leadership. It&apos;s not he parked in his handicapped spot or that he was nasty to people. It&apos;s that his total responsibility for his products from ends to ends, that he took products above return on investment, and that he wasn&apos;t a slave to focus groups.</div><div><br/></div><div>Those are lessons that American business, &nbsp;which has for decades focused more on bottom lines than real innovation, should heed. &nbsp;Where there are plenty of people in Silicon Valley who envy Jobs&apos; cult of personality, experts like Mike Useem, header of leadership at Washington, says he probably succeed in spite of this: &quot;Jobs built a good team, but he would have gotten even better people if he&apos;d been less touch on them.&quot; Research shows that there are plenty of narcissists in the corner office, but it finds that they are tend to be bad managers. In fact, to the extent they succeed, it&apos;s usually because of other qualities: like long-term vision and relentless execution.</div><div><br/></div><div>Jobs had both, but more important, he had entrepreneurial impulse to put engineers above bean counters in corporate hierarchy. As Jobs told Isan, My passion has been to build an enduring company where people are motivated to make great products. Everything else was secondary. Sure, it is great to make profit, because that was what allowed you to make great products. But, the products, not profits, were the motivation. It&apos;s subtle difference, but it ends up meaning everything. The people you hire, who get promoted, what you discuss in meetings.</div><div><br/></div><div>Focusing on products meant making a long view - another keys Jobs leadership lesson. After dotcom bubble burst in 2000, most of Silicon Valley stopped spending. Apple, meanwhile, started ramping up research and development, hoping to invent a lot of innovative products that would put it ahead of other competitions after the downturn.</div><div><br/></div><div>It worked. Out of the recession came the iPod and iTunes store, Apple stores and even a new operating system OS X. Steve spends lots of time stressing to me how the seed planted during the downturn. Sometimes, over the skiptisim of his board and investors, grew into the products that turn Apple into the world&apos;s most valuable company. Jobs didn&apos;t worry, he said about explaining to the Street &quot;why building a brunch of glass shrines with only 12 products in them was a good return on investment.&quot; He probably would have shrugged off questions about company&apos;s business practice in China, as he had in the past. The truth is that the investment during a downturn is almost always a good business. China&apos;s solar industry has leaped ahead of other competitors by piling on investment since the financial crisis. In the U.S, there is still 2 trillion worth of cash sitting on corporate balance sheet. And there are few CEOs willing to make the same kind of bold investment choice Jobs did.</div><div><br/></div><div>That&apos;s the dilemma facing business schools today. Jobs stands out as a exceptional leader not so much because of his in-your-face style but because that American business are dominated by bean counters seeking hypereffiency rather than by innovators focused on real growth.&nbsp;</div></en-note>'

But Wikipedia&apos;s larger message was clear: none of us should take for granted the freedom and openness that have made the Web such world-changing resource. Why make that point now? Because Wikipedia and several other major Internet companies fear the Internet is facing a serious threat from potential government regulation. Under intense pressures from movie studio, big music and media companies, the U.S Congress has been moving to create a new legal powers to track down on the websites that offer illegal streaming and downloading of movies, music and other copyrighted contents.\n<div><br/></div><div>Two bills in Congress, the House&apos;s Stop Online Privacy Act(SOPA) and the senate&apos;s Protect Intellectual Property Act would empower courts to make search engine like Google block alleged copyright violate from their searching results and force advertisers to cut off payments to the offending sites. That has unleashed the latest battles in long-running war between Hollywood and Silicon Valley over how to balance the copyright issues with Internet freedom. The showdown in Congress pits the recording and movies industries&apos; well-connected lobbyists against the dotcome&apos;s combined power of Internet sentiment and their own equally well-connected lobbyists.</div><div><br/></div><div><br/><div><br/></div><div><br/></div></div></en-note>'

Is 1982 repeating itself?</div><div><br/></div><div>The past is a foreign country. said the English novelist Hartley. They do things differently there. However true Hartley&apos;s observation is of other country, it is not true of his naive land. The trouble with England is that the past never leaves you alone. Just when you think it is dead, the damn thing clambers out of grave.</div><div><br/></div><div>The passage of 30 years has not made the Britain of 2012 noticeable different from the Britain of 1982. Once again the conservative Prime Minister is presiding over an economic issues -- Once again, there are street riots and mass unemployment. And then as now there is talk of war in the Falkland island.</div><div><br/></div><div>When the Argentines invaded the Falkland island in 1982, my left-wing friends and I wondered for a moment if we would be called up -- the 20th century had been a history of generations of young men conscripted for war. After we realized Her Majesty&apos;s navy could manage without us, we settle down to marvel at the absurdity of the conflict over an abandoned coaling for Britain ships.</div><div><br/></div><div>The Falkland war was &quot;two bald men fighting over a comb&quot;, snapped the Argentine writer and poet Jorge Luis Borge. But even this master of absurdism could not capture how ridiculous the conflict seemed to the minority of us not caught up in the patriotic fervor. Trying to divert attention from vicious rule and economic incompetence, the Argentine military junta revived a claim to Falkland island -- Which had not had Argentine presence since 1830s. Determined to prove herself a Churchillian war leader, Thatcher stood firm. She fought and won a war over territory most Britain not realized they governed. Nine hundred Argentine and Britain servicemen, and three islanders, died for bleak, storm-tossed island with our apparent resources beyond bleak, storm-tossed sheep.&nbsp;</div><div><br/></div><div>Now, as some conductor&apos;s cue, the drum of war are beating again. Argentine politicians claimed the island to prove their patriotism. They refused to cooperate with Falklanders in monitoring fish stock and searching for oil. They ban Falkland-flagged ships from their ports. When Prince William arrived in uniform of air-force helicopter pilot to guard the 3000 islander, the Argentine Foreign Ministry described him as a &quot;conquistor&quot;. Meanwhile, the Britain press, liable to get excited about royal in battle zones than ordinary soldiers and sailors, remembered that Prince Andrew served as a pilot in 1982 war.</div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div></en-note>'

Approaching craft from the point of view of function, we can divide them into three simple categories: containers, shelters, and supports. There is no way around the fact that the container, shelter and supports must be functional. The applied arts are thus bound to the law of physics, which pertain to both the material used in their making and the substances and things to be contained, supported and sheltered. These laws are universal in their applications, regardless of culture beliefs, geography, or climate. If a pot has no bottom or has a large openings in its sides, it could hardly be considered a container, in any traditional sense. Since the laws of physics, not some arbitrary decision, have determined to the general form of applied-art objects, they follow some basic pattern, so much so that functional form can vary only within certain limits. Buildings without roofs, for example, are unusual, because they depart from the norm. However, not all functional objects are exactly alike; that is why we recognize Shang Dynasty vase as being different from an Inca vase. What varies is not the basic form but the incidental detains that do not obstruct the object&apos;s primary function.&nbsp;\n<div><br/></div><div>Sensitivity to physical laws is thus an important consideration for the makers of applied-art objects. It is often taken for granted that this is also true for the makers of fine-art objects. This assumption misses a significant difference between the two discipline. Fine-art objects are not constrained by the law of physics in the same way that applied-art objects are. Because their primary purpose is not functional, they are only limited in term of material used to make them. Sculptures must, for example, be stable for the understanding of the properties of mass, weight distribution and stress. Painting must have rigid stretcher, so that the canvas will be taut, and the paints must not deteriorate, crack or discolor. These are problems that must be overcome by the artiest because they tend to intrude upon his or her conception of work. For example, in the early Italian Renaissance, bronze status of horses with a raised foreleg usually had a cannonball under that hoof. This was done because the cannonball was needed to support the weight of the leg. In other words, the demands of the laws of physics, not the artiest&apos; aesthetic intentions, placed the ball there. That this device is a necessary compromise is clear from the fact that the cannonball quickly disappeared when the sculptors learned how to strengthen the internal structure of a status with iron braces.</div><div><br/></div><div>Even though, the fine arts in the twentieth century, often treat material in new ways, the basic difference in attitude of artiest in relation to their material in the fine arts and applied arts remains relatively constant. It would therefore not be too great an exaggeration to say that the practitioner of fine arts work to overcome the limitations of their materials, whereas those engaged in applied arts work in concert with their materials.&nbsp;</div></en-note>'

They breath through their lungs, not through gills, and give birth to live young. Their streamlined bodies, the absence of hind legs, and the presence of a fluke and blowhole cannot disguise their affinities with land dwelling mammals. However, unlike the cases of sea otters and pinnipeds(seals, sea lions, and wlruses, whose limbs are functional both on land and at sea), It is not easy to envision what the first whales looked like. Extinct but already fully marine cetaceans are known from the fossil record. How was the gap between a walking mammal and a swimming mammal bridged? Missing until recently were fossils, clearly intermediate, or transitional between land mammals and cetaceans.</font><div><font face="Georgia"><br/></font></div><div><font face="Georgia">Very exciting discoveries have allowed scientists to reconstruct the most likely origins of cetaceans. In 1979, a team looking for fossils in the northern Pakistan found what to be proved the oldest fossils whale. The fossils were officially named Pakicetus in honor of the country where the discovery was made. Pakicetus was found embedded in rocks formed from river deposits that were 52 million years ago. The river that formed these deposits were actually not far from an ancient ocean known as Tethys Sea.</font></div><div><font face="Georgia"><br/></font></div><div><font face="Georgia">The fossil consists of a complete skull of an archetatypic, a group of ancestors of modern cetaceans. Although limited to the skull, Pakicetus provides previous details on the origin of cetaceans. The skull is cetacean-like but its jawbone lacks the enlarged space that is filled with fat, oils, and used to receiving underwater sounds in modern whales. Pakicetus probably detected sound through ear opening as in land mammals. The skull also lacks a blowholl, another cetacean adaptation for diving. Other features, however, show experts that Pakicetus is a transitional form between a group of extinct flesh-eating mammals, the mesonychids, and cetaceans. It has been suggested that Pakinstus fed on fish in shallow water and was not yet adapted for life in the open ocean. It probably bred and give birth on land.&nbsp;</font></div><div><font face="Georgia"><br/></font></div><div><font face="Georgia">Another major discovery was made in Egypt in 1989. Several skeletons of another early whale, Basilosaurus, was found in sediments left by the Tethys Sea and now exposed in the Sahara desert. This whale lived around 40 million years ago, 12 million years after Pakicetus. Many incomplete skeletons were found, but for the first time in archaectoyle, a complete hind leg that features a foot with three tiny toes. Such legs would have been far too small to have supported the 50-foot-long Basilosaurus on land. Basilosaurus was undoubtedly a fully marine whale with possibly nonfunctional, or vestigial, hind legs.</font></div><div><font face="Georgia"><br/></font></div><div><font face="Georgia">An even more exciting find was reported in 1944, also from Pakistan. The now extinct whale Ambulocetus natans lived in the Tethys Sea 49 millions years ago. It lived around 3 million years after Pakicetus but 9 million before Basilosaurus. The fossil luckily included a good portion of the bind legs. The legs were strong and ended in long feet very much like those of a modern pinniped. The legs were certainly functional both on land and at sea.&nbsp;</font></div></en-note>'

The expansion of desert-like conditions into areas where they previously did not exist is called desertification. It has been esteemed that an additional one-fourth of the Earth&apos;s land surface is threatened by this process.\n<div><br/></div><div>The desertification is accomplished primarily through the loss of stabilizing nature vegetation and the subsequent accelerated erosion of soil by wind and water. In some cases, the loose soil is blown completely away, leaving a stony surface. In other cases, finer particles may be removed, while sand-size particles are accumulated to form mobile hills or ridges of sand.</div><div><br/></div><div>Even in the area that retain a soil cover, the reduction of vegetation typically results in the loss of soil&apos;s ability to absolve substantial quantities of water. The impact of raindrops on the loose soil tend to transfer fine clay particles to the tiniest particles soil spaces, sealing them and producing a surface that allows very little water penetration. Water absorption is greatly reduced; Consequently, runoff is increased, resulting in accelerated erosion rate. The gradual dying of the soil caused by its diminished ability to absolve water results in the future loss of vegetation, so that a cycle of progressive surface deterioration is established.&nbsp;</div><div><br/></div><div>In some regions, the increase in desert areas is occurring as largely as a result of a trend toward drier climates conditions. Continued gradually global warming has produced an increase in aridity for some areas over the past few thousand years. The process may be accelerated in subsequent decades if the global warming resulting from air pollution seriously increases.</div><div><br/></div><div>There is little doubts, however, that desertification in most areas results primarily from human activities rather than nature processes. The semiarid lands bordering the dessert exist in a delicate ecological balance and are limited in their potential to adjust to increased environmental pressures. Expanding population are subjecting the lands to increasing pressures to provide them with food and fuel. In wet periods, lands may be able to respond to this stresses. During the dry periods that are common phenomena along dessert margins, though, the pressure on the land is often far in exceed of its diminished capacity, and desertification results.</div><div><br/></div><div>Four specific activities have been identified as major contributors to the desertification processes. Over-cultivation, over-grazing, firewood gathering and over-irrigation. The cultivation of crops has expanded into progressively drier regions as population density has grown. These regions are specially likely to have period of server dryness, so that the crop failures are common. Since the raising of most crops necessitates the prior removal of natural vegetation, crop failures leave extensive tracts of land devoid of a plant cover and susceptible to wind and water erosion.&nbsp;</div><div><br/></div><div>The raising of livestock is a major economic activities in the semi-arid areas where grasses are generally the dominant type of natural vegetation. The consequence of an excessive number of livestock grazing into an area is the reduction of vegetation cover and the trampling and pulverization of the soil. This is usually followed by the drying of soil and accelerated erosion.</div><div><br/></div><div>Firewood is the chef fuel used for cook and heating in many countries. The increased pressures of expanding populations had led to the removal of woody plant so that many cities and towns are surrounded by large land completely lacking trees and shrubs. The increasing use of drying animal waste as substitute fuel has also hurt the soil because these valuable soil conditioners and source of plant nutrients are no longer being returned to the land.</div><div><br/></div><div>The final major human cause of desertification is salinization resulting from over-irrigation. Excess water of irrigation sinks down into water table. If no drainage system exists, the water table arises, bring dissolved salt to the surface. The water evaporates, and salt is left behind, creating a white crustal layer, which prevents air and water from reaching the underlying soil.</div><div><br/></div><div>The extreme seriousness of desertification results from the vast areas of land and the tremendous number of people affected, as well as from the great difficult of reversing or even slowing the process. Once the soil has been removed by erosion, only the passage of centuries and millennia will enable new soil to form. In areas where considerable soil remains, though, a rigorously enforced program of land protecting and cover-crop planting may make it possible to reverse the present desertification of the surface.&nbsp;</div></en-note>'

In the peepshow format, a film was viewed through a small opening in a machine that was created for that purpose. Tomas Edison&apos;s peepshow device, called Kinetoscope, was introduced to the public in 1984. It was designed for Kinetoscope parlous, arcades, which contained only a few individual machines and permitted only one consumer to view a show, 50-foot film at any one time. The first Kinetoscope parlous contained five machines. For the price of 25 cents(or 5 cents per film), customers moved from machine to machine to watch five different films.\n<div><br/></div><div>These Kinetoscope arcades was modeled on phonograph parlous, which had proven successfully for Edison several years early. In Kinetoscope parlous, customers listened to recording through individual era tubes, moving from one machine to the next to here different recording of speech, or pieces of music. The Kinectoscope parlous functioned in a similar way. Edison was more interested in the sale of Kinetoscope to the parlous, rather than in the file that would be run in them. He refused to develop projection technology, reasoning that if he made and sold projectors, then, exhibitors would purchase only a machine-a projector from him instead of several.</div><div><br/></div><div>Exhibitors, however, want to maximize their profits, which they could do more readily by projecting handful of films to hundreds of customers at a time(rather than one at a time) and by charging 25 to 50 cents admission.&nbsp;</div><div><br/></div><div>With the advent of projection in 1985 to 1896, motion pictures became the ultimate form of mass consumption. Previous, large audiences had viewed spectacles at a theater, where ... shows had been presented to hundreds of spectators at a time. But movies differed significantly from these other form of entertainment, which depend on either live performance or the active involvement of master ceremonies who assembled the final program.</div><div><br/></div><div>Although, early exhibitors regular accompanied movies with live acts, the substance of movies themselves were mass-produced, prerecorded materials that can easily be reproduced by theater with little or no active participant by the exhibitor. Even though, early exhibitors shaped their films by mixing film with other type of entertainment in whichever way they though would be attractive to audiences or by accompanying them with lectures, their creative control remained limited. What audiences came to see was the technological marvel of the movies; the lifelike reproduction of commonplace motion of trains, of wave striking the shore and the talking of people; the magic possible made by trick photography and the manipulation of camera.&nbsp;</div><div><br/></div><div>With the advent of projection, the viewer&apos;s relationship with images were no longer private, as it has been with earlier peepshow devices such as K and M, which was the similar machine that produced motion by means of successive images on individual photographic cards instead of on trips of celluloid. It suddenly became public -- an experience that the viewer shared with dozens, scores or even hundreds of others. At the same time, the image the spectators looked at expanded from the minuscule of peepshow dimension of 1 to 2 inch(in height) to the life-size proportions of 6 - 9 feet.</div><div><br/></div></en-note>'

Psychologists have adopted several approaches to understanding this aggression behavior in people.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div><br clear="none"/></div>\n<div>The Biological Approach</div>\n<div><br clear="none"/></div>\n<div>Numerous biological structures and chemicals appeared to be involved in aggression. One is is hy.., a region of the brain. In response to certain stimuli, many animals show instinctive aggression reactions. The hypo.. appeared to be involved in this inborn reaction pattern: electrical simulations of parts of hypo... triggered stereotypical aggression behaviors in many animals. In people, however, whose brain are more complex, other brain structures apparently moderate possible instinct.</div>\n<div><br clear="none"/></div>\n<div>An offshoot of the biological approach called sociology suggests that aggression is natural and even desirable for people. Sociobiology views many social behaviors, including aggression behaviors, as genetically determined. Consider the Darwin\'s theory of evolution. Darwin held that many more individual are produced than can find food and survive to adulthood. A struggle for survival follows. Those individual possess characteristics that provide them with advantage in the struggle for existence are more likely to survive and contribute their genes to the next generation. In many species, such characteristics include aggressiveness. Because aggressive individuals are more likely to survive and reproduce, whatever their genes linked to aggression behaviors are more likely to be transmitted to subsequent generation.</div>\n<div><br clear="none"/></div>\n<div>The sociobiology view had been attacked by numerous grounds. One is that people\'s capacity to outwit other species, not their aggressiveness, appeared to be the dominant factor in human survival. Another is that there are too many variation among people to believe that they are dominated by, or at the mercy of, aggressive impulses.</div>\n<div><br clear="none"/></div>\n<div>The Psychodynamic Approach</div>\n<div><br clear="none"/></div>\n<div>Theorists adopting psychodynamic approach hold that inner conflicts are crucial to understand human behaviors, including aggression. Sigmoun Fred, believed that aggressive impulses are inevitable to the frustration of daily life. Children normally desired to vent aggressive impulses on other people including their parents, because even the most attentive parents can not gratify all of their demands immediately. Yet, children, also fearing parents\' punishment and the lost of parental love, come to repress most aggressive impulse. The Freden prospective, in a sense: &quot;see us as steam engines&quot; By holding in rather than venting &quot;steam&quot;, we set the stage for future explosions. Pent-up aggressive impulse demands outlets. They may be expressed toward parents in indirect ways such as destroying furniture, they also may be expressed toward strangers later in life.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div><br clear="none"/></div>\n<div>According to pyschodynamic approach, the best way to prevent harmful aggression may be to encourage less harmful aggression. In steam-engine analogy, verbal aggression may vent some aggression steam.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div><br clear="none"/></div>\n<div>The Cognitive Approach</div>\n<div><br clear="none"/></div>\n<div>Cognitive psychologists assert that our behaviors are influenced by our values, by the ways in which we interpret out situations and by choice. For example, people who believe that aggression is necessary and justified-as during wartime-likely to act aggressively, whereas people who believe a particular way or act of aggression is unjust, or who think that aggression is never justified, are less likely to behave aggressively.</div>\n<div><br clear="none"/></div>\n<div>Our cognitive theory suggests that aggravating and harmful events triggers unpleasant feeling.\xc2\xa0 These feeling, in turn, can lead to aggressive actions, but not automatically. Cognitive factors intervenes.\xc2\xa0 People decide they will act aggressively or not on the basis of factors such as their experience with aggression and their interpretation of other people\'s motives. Supporting evidence comes from research showing that aggressive people often distort other people\'s motives. For example, they assume that other people mean them harm when they do not.</div>\n<div><br clear="none"/></div>\n<div><br clear="none"/></div>\n<div><br clear="none"/></div>\n<div><br clear="none"/></div>\n<div><br clear="none"/></div>\n<div><br clear="none"/></div></en-note>'

S'<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>\n<!DOCTYPE en-note SYSTEM "http://xml.evernote.com/pub/enml2.dtd">\n<en-note><div>The development of modern presidency in the United States began with Andrew Jackson who swept to power in 1829 at the head of Democratic Party and served until 1837. During his administration, he immeasurably enlarged the power of the presidency. &quot;The president is the direct representative of American people.&quot; he lectured the Senate when it opposed him. &quot;He was elected by the people, and is responsible to them.&quot; With this declaration, Jackson redefined the character of presidential office and its relationship to the people.</div>\n<div><br clear="none"/></div>\n<div>During Jackson\'s second term, his opponents had gradually come together to form the Whig Party. Whigs and Democrats held different attitudes toward the changes brought about by market, bank and commerce. The Democrats tended to view society as a continuing conflicts between &quot;the people&quot;--farmers, planters and workers and a set of greedy aristocrats. The &quot;paper money aristocracy&quot; of bankers and inventors manipulated the banking system for their own profit, the Democrats declaimed, and sapped the nation\'s virtue by encouraging speculation and the desire for sudden, unearned wealth. The Democrats wanted the rewards of market without sacrificing the features of agrarian republic. They wanted the wealth offered by market without competitive, changing society; the complex dealing; the dominants of urban center; the loss of independence that came with it.</div>\n<div><br clear="none"/></div>\n<div>The Whigs, on the other hand, were more comfortable with the market. For them, commerce and economic development were agents of civilization. Nor did they envision any conflicts in society between farmers and workers on the one hand and businesspeople and bankers on the other hand. Economic development will benefit anyone by raising the national income and expanding opportunity. The government\'s responsibility is to provide a well-regulated economy that guaranteed the opportunity for citizens of ability.</div>\n<div><br clear="none"/></div>\n<div>Wigs and Democrats differed not only in their attitude toward the markets, but also about how active the central government should be in people\'s lives. Despite Andrew Jackson\'s inclination to be a strong president, Democrats as a rule believed in limited government. Government\'s rule in economy was to promote competition by destroying monopolies and special privilege. In keeping with the philosophy of limited government, Democrats also rejected the idea that moral beliefs were the proper sphere of government action. Religions and politics, they believed, should be kept clearly separate, and they gradually opposed humanitarian legislation.</div>\n<div><br clear="none"/></div>\n<div>The Whigs, in contrast, viewed the government power positively. They believed it should be used to protect for individual rights and public liberty, and that it had special role where individual effect was ineffective. By regulating competition and economy, government could ensure equal opportunity. Indeed, for Whigs the concepts of government promoting general welfare went beyond the economy. In particular, Whigs in northern sections of the United States also believed that government power should be used to foster the moral welfare of country. They were more likely to favor social-reform legislation and aids to education.</div>\n<div><br clear="none"/></div>\n<div>In some ways, the social makeup of the two parties was similar. To be more competitive in winning votes, Whigs and Democrats both had to have significant supports among farmers, the largest group in the society, and works. Neither party could win an election by appealing exclusively to the rich or the poor. The Whigs, however, enjoyed disproportionate strength among business and commercial classes. Whigs appealed to planters who needed credit to finance their cotton and rich trade in the world market, to farmers who were eager to sell their surpluses, to workers who wanted to improve themselves. Democrats attracted farmers isolated from market or uncomfortable with it, workers alienated from the emerging industrial systems, rising entrepreneurs who want to break monopolies and open the opportunity to newcomers like themselves. Whigs were strongest in towns, cities, and those rural areas that was fully integrated into market economy, whereas, Democrats dominated areas of semisubsistence farming that were more isolated and languishing economically.</div>\n<div><br clear="none"/></div>\n<div><br clear="none"/></div>\n<div><br clear="none"/></div>\n<div><br clear="none"/></div>\n<div><br clear="none"/></div>\n<div><br clear="none"/></div>\n<div><br clear="none"/></div>\n<div><br clear="none"/></div>\n<div><br clear="none"/></div></en-note>'

There are two principal influences that shaped the terrain: one is constructive process, like uplift, which create the landscape feature, the other is destructive fores, such as erosion, which gradually wear away eroded landforms.</div>\n<div><br clear="none"/></div>\n<div>Hills and mountains are often regarded as the epitome of permanence, successfully resisting the destructive forces of nature, but in fact, they tend to be relatively short-lived in geological terms. As a general rule, the higher a mountain is, the more recently it was formed. For example, the high mountains of the Himalayas was only 50 million years ago. Lower mountains tend to be older, and are often the eroded relics of higher mountain chains. About 400 million years ago, when the present-day continents of North American and Europe were joined, the Caledoion mountain chain was the same size as modern Himalayas. Now the relics of Caledoion orogency(the mountain building period) only exist as the relatively low mountain of Greenland, ....</div>\n<div><br clear="none"/></div>\n<div>The Earth\'s crust was thought to be divided into huge, movable segments, called plates, which float on a soft plastic layer of rock. Some mountains were formed as a result of these plates crashing into each other and forcing up the rocks at the plate margins. In this process, sedimentary rocks that originally formed on seabed may be folded upward to altitude of more than 26,000 feet. Other mountains may be raised by earthquake, which fractures the Earth\'s crust and can displace enough rock to produce block mountains. The third type of mountains may be formed as a result of volcanic activity which occurs in the regions of active fold mountain belts, such as in the Cascade range of west North America. The Cascades are made up of lavas and volcanic materials. Many of peak are extinct of volcanoes.</div>\n<div><br clear="none"/></div>\n<div>Whatever the reason for mountain formation, as soon as land rises above sea level, it is subjected to destructive forces. The exposed rocks are attacked by various weather processes and gradually broken down into fragments, which are then carried away and later deposited as sentiments. Thus, any landscape represents a temporary stage in the continuous battle between the forces of uplift and those of erosion.</div>\n<div><br clear="none"/></div>\n<div>Weather, in its various forms, are the main agent of erosion. Rain washes away loose soil and penetrates cracks in the rock. Carbon dioxide in the air, reacts with the rainwater, forming a weak acid (carbonic acid) that may chemically attacks rocks. The rain seeps underground and water may reappear later as springs. These springs are the main source of stream and river, which cut though the rock and carried away the debris from mountains to low lands.</div>\n<div><br clear="none"/></div>\n<div>Under very cold conditions, rocks can be shattered by ice and frost. Glaciers may formed in permanently cold areas, and those slowly moving mass of ice cut out valleys, carrying with them huge quantities eroded rock debris. In dry area the wind is the principal agent of erosion.\xc2\xa0 It carries fine particles of sand, which bombard exposed rock surfaces, thereby wearing away them into yet more sand. Even living things contribute to the formation of landscape. Tree roots forces their way into cracks in the rock, and in so doing, speed their splitting. In contrast, the root of grasses and other small plants may hold loose soil fragments together, thereby helping to prevent the erosion of wind.\xc2\xa0</div></en-note>'

By far, the most abundant type of groundwater is meteoric water; this is the groundwater that circulates as part of water cycle. Ordinary meteoric water is the water that have soaked into the ground from the surface, from precipitation(snow and water), from lakes and streams. There it remains, as for long period, before emerging at the surface again. At first though it seems incredible that there can be enough space in the &quot;solid&quot; ground underfoot to hold all this water.</div>\n<div><br clear="none"/></div>\n<div>The necessary space is there, however, in many forms. The commonest spaces are those among the particles -- sand grains and tiny pebbles -- of loose, unconsolidated sand and gravel. Beds of this material, out of sight beneath the soil, are common. There are found wherever fast river carrying the loads of coarse sediments once flowed. For example, the great ice sheets that covered the North America during the last ice age steadily melted away, huge volumes of water flowed from them. The water was laden with pebbles, gravel and sand, known as glacial outwash, that was deposited as the flow slowed down.</div>\n<div><br clear="none"/></div>\n<div>The same thing happens to this days, though on a small scale, wherever the sediment-laden river or streams emerge from mountain valley onto relatively flat land, dropping its load as the current slows. The water usually spreads out fanwise, depositing the sentiment in the form of a smooth, fan-shaped slope. The sentiments are dropped wherever a river slows on entering a lake or sea, those dropped sentiments are on a lake floor or sea floor at first, but they will be located inland at some future time, when the sea level falls or land rises; those beds are usually thousands of meter thick.</div>\n<div><br clear="none"/></div>\n<div>In lowland country, almost every spot on the ground may overlie what was once the beds of river that has since become buried by the soil; If they are below the water\'s upper surface(the water table), the gravel and sand of the former riverbeds and its sandbars will be saturated with groundwater.</div>\n<div><br clear="none"/></div>\n<div>So much for unconsolidated sentiments. Consolidated(or cemented) sentiments, too, contain millions of minute water-holding pores. This is because the gap among original grains, are not totally plugged by cementing chemicals; also parts of those original grains may become be dissolved by percolating groundwater, either while the consolidation is taking place, or at any time afterwards. The result is that sandstone, for example, can be as porous as loose sand from which it was formed.</div>\n<div><br clear="none"/></div>\n<div>Thus a proportion of the total volume of any sentiments, consists of empty space.</div>\n<div><br clear="none"/></div>\n<div>The proportion of empty space in a rock is known as porosity. But note that the porosity is not same as the permeability, which measures the ease with which water flows through the material; It depends on the size of individual cavities and crevices linking them.</div>\n<div><br clear="none"/></div>\n<div>Much of water in a sample of water-saturated sentiments or rock will drain from it if the sample is put in a suitable dry place. But some will remain, clinging to all solid surface. It is held there by the force of surface intension without which the water drains instantly from any wet places, leaving it totally dry. The total volume of water in the sample of saturated sentiment must therefore be thought of as consisting of water that can, and water that can not drain away.</div>\n<div><br clear="none"/></div>\n<div>The relative amount of this two kinds of water can vary greatly from one kind of sentiments or rocks to another, even though their porosity may be the same. What happens depends on the pore size. If the pore is large, the water in them will exist as drops two heavy for the surface tension to hold, and it will drain away. If the pore is small enough, the water in them will exist as thin films, too light to overcome the force of surface tension holding them in place. Thus the water will be firmly held.</div>\n<div><br clear="none"/></div>\n<div><br clear="none"/></div>\n<div><br clear="none"/></div>\n<div><br clear="none"/></div>\n<div><br clear="none"/></div>\n<div><br clear="none"/></div>\n<div><br clear="none"/></div></en-note>'

S'<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>\n<!DOCTYPE en-note SYSTEM "http://xml.evernote.com/pub/enml2.dtd">\n<en-note><div>In seeking to describe the origins of theater, one must rely primarily on speculation, since there is little concrete evidence on what to draw. The most widely accepted theory, championed by anthropologists in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries envisions theater as emerging out of myth and ritual. The process perceived by those anthropologists can be summarized briefly.\xc2\xa0 During the early stages of development, a society becomes aware of forces that appear to influence or control its food supply and well-being. Having little understanding of natural causes, it attributes both desirable and undesirable occurrences to supernatural or magical forces, and it searches for means to win the favor of these forces. Perceiving apparent connections between certain actions performed by the group and the result it desires, the group repeats, refines, and formalizes those actions to fixed ceremonies, or rituals.</div>\n<div><br clear="none"/></div>\n<div>Stories(myths) may grow up around the rituals. Frequently the myths include the representatives of supernatural forces that the rites celebrate or hope to influence. Performers may wear customs and masks to represent the mythical characters or supernatural forces in the rituals and accompanying celebrations. As a person becomes sophisticated, its conceptions of supernatural forces and causal relationships may change. As a result, it may abandon or modify some rites. But myths that have grown up around the rites may continue as a part of the group\'s oral tradition and may even comes to be acted out under conditions divorced from these rites. When this occurs, the first step have been taken toward theater as a autonomous activity, thereafter entertainment and aesthetic values gradually replace the former mythical or socially efficacious concerns.</div>\n<div><br clear="none"/></div>\n<div>Although the origin in the rituals has long been the most popular, it is by no means the only theory about how the theater comes into being. Storytelling has been proposed as a one alternative. Under this theory, relating and listening to stories are seen as fundamental human pleasures. Thus, the recalling of event(hunt, battle, and feat) is elaborated through the narrator\'s pantomime and impersonation and eventually through each role being assumed by a different person.</div>\n<div><br clear="none"/></div>\n<div>A closed relative theory sees theater as evolving out of dances that are primarily pantomimic, rhythmical or gymnastic, or from imitations of animal noise and sound. Admirations for performer\'s skill, virtuosity, and grace, are seen as motivation for elaborating the activities into fully realized theatrical performances.</div>\n<div><br clear="none"/></div>\n<div>In addition to find the possible antecedent of theater, scholars have also theorized about the motives that let people to develop theater. Why people develop theater, and was it valued after it ceased to fulfill the function of rituals. Most answers fall back on the theory about human mind and basic human need. One, set the forth by Aristol in 4th century, seeing human as natural imitative -- taking pleasure in imitating persons, things, and actions and in seeing such imitation. Another, advanced in twentieth century, suggests that human have a gift for fantasy, through which they seek to reshape the reality to more satisfying forms than those encountered in the daily life. Thus, fantasy and fiction(of which drama is one form) permits people to objectify their anxieties and fears, confront them, and fulfill their hopes in fiction if not fact. The theater, thus, is one tool whereby people define and understanding the world, or escape from unpleasant reality.</div>\n<div><br clear="none"/></div>\n<div>But, neither the human imitative instinct nor a penchant for fantasy by itself leads to an autonomous theater. Therefore, additional explanations are needed. One necessary condition seems to be somewhat detached view of human problem. For example, one sign of this condition is the appearance of the comic vision, since remedy requires sufficient detachment to view derivations from social norms as ridiculous rather than as serious threats to the welfare of the whole group. Another condition contributes to the development of autonomous theater is the emergences of aesthetic sense. For example, some early societies ceased to consider certain rites essential to their well-being and abandon them, they retained as part of their oral tradition the myth that grow up around the rites, and admire them for their artistic qualities rather than for their religious usefulness.</div>\n<div><br clear="none"/></div>\n<div><br clear="none"/></div>\n<div><br clear="none"/></div>\n<div><br clear="none"/></div>\n<div><br clear="none"/></div>\n<div><br clear="none"/></div>\n<div><br clear="none"/></div>\n<div><br clear="none"/></div>\n<div><br clear="none"/></div>\n<div><br clear="none"/></div>\n<div><br clear="none"/></div></en-note>'

Because architecture grows out of human needs and inspirations, it clearly communicates cultural values. Of all the visual arts, architecture affects our life most directly for it determines the character of human environment in major ways.\n<div><br/></div><div>Architecture is a three-dimensional form. It utilize space, mass, texture, line, light and color. To be architecture, a building must achieve a working harmony with a variety of elements. Humans instinctively seek builds that will shelter and enhance their ways of life. It is the work of architects to create buildings that are not only a simple construction, but offer inspiration and delight. Buildings contribute to human life when they provide shelter, enrich space, complement their sites, suit the climate and are economically feasible. The client who pays for the building and defines its function is an important member of architectural team. The mediocre design of many contemporary buildings can be traced to both clients and architects.</div><div><br/></div><div>In order for structures to achieve the size and strength to meet its purposes, architecture employs methods of support that, because they are based on physical laws, have changed little since people first discovered them -- even while the building material have changed dramatically. The world&apos;s architectural buildings have also been devised in relation to the objective limitation of material. The structure can be analyzed in terms of how they dealt with downward forces created by gravity. They are designed to withstand the forces of compression(pushing together), tension(pull parts), blending, or a combination of these in different parts of structure.&nbsp;</div><div><br/></div><div>Even the development in architecture has been the result of major technological changes. Materials and methods of construction are integral parts of design of architecture structures. In early times, it is necessary to design structural systems suitable for the material that are available, such as wood, stone and brick. Today technology has progressed to the point where it is possible to invent new material to suit for the type of structure desired. Enormous changes in material and techniques of construction with the last few generations have made it possible to enclose space with much greater ease and speed and with a minimum of material. Progress in this area can be measured by the difference in weight between buildings built today and those of comparable size built one hundred years ago.</div><div><br/></div><div>Modern architectural forms generally have three separated components comparable to elements of human body: a supporting skeleton or frame, an outer skin enclosing the interior spaces and equipment similar to the body&apos;s virtal organs and systems. The equipment usually includes plumbing, electrical wiring, hot water and air-conditioning. Of course, in early architectures, such as igloos and adobe structures, there is no such equipment and the skeleton and skin are often one.</div><div><br/></div><div>Much of world&apos;s great architecture has been constructed of stone, because its beauty, permanence and availability. In the past, whole cities grow from the arduous task of cutting and pilling stones upon. The doorways and windows are made possible by placing over open spaces brick stones beam that supporting the weight from above. A structural invention had to be made before the physical limitations of stone could be overcome and new architectural form could be created. That invention was the arch, a curved structures originally made by separated stones or brick segments. The arch, was first used by the early cultures of Mediterrean areas briefly for underground drains, but it was the Romans who first developed and used the arch extensively in aboveground structures. Roman builders perfected the semicircular arches made of stones or brick. As a method of spanning space, the arch can support much greater weights than a horizontal beam. It works in compression to divert the weight from above it out to the sides, where the weight is borne to the vertical elements on neither sides of the arch. The arch is among many important structural break-though that characterize the architecture throughout centuries. &nbsp;</div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div></en-note>'

Ecologists use the term &quot;succession&quot; to refer to the changes that happen in plant communities and ecosystems over time. The first community in a succession is called pioneer community, while the most long-lived community at the end of a succession is called climax succession.\xc2\xa0 Pioneer and successional plant communities are said to change over period from 1 to 500 years. Those changes -- in number of plants and the mix of species are cumulative. Climax communities themselves change but over period of time greater than about 500 years.</div>\n<div><br clear="none"/></div>\n<div>An Ecologist who studies pond today may find it relatively unchanged in a year\'s time. An individual fish may be replaced, but the number of fish will tend to be the same from one year to the next year. We can say that the properties of ecosystem will be more stable than individual organisms that compose the ecosystem.</div>\n<div><br clear="none"/></div>\n<div>At one time, ecologists believed that specie diversity made ecosystem stable. They believed that the greater the diversity the more stable the ecosystem. Support for this idea came from the observation that long-lasting climax community usually have more complex food webs and more species diversity than pioneer community. Ecologists concluded that the apparent stability of climax communities depended on their complexity. To take an extreme example, farmlands dominated by a single crop are so unstable that one year of bad weather or the invasion of a single pest can destroy the entire crops. In contrast, a complex community, such as a temperate forest, will tolerate considerable damage from weather to pest.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div><br clear="none"/></div>\n<div>The question of ecosystem stability is complicated, however. The first problem is that ecologists do not all agree what &quot;stability&quot; means. Stability can be defined as simply lack of change. In that means, the climax community would be considered as the most stable, since by the definition, they change the least over time. Alternatively, stability can be defined as the speed with which a ecosystem return to a particular form following a major disturbance, such as a fire. This kind of stability is also called resilience. In that case, climax community would be the most fragile and the least stable, since they can require hundreds of years to return to the climax state.</div>\n<div><br clear="none"/></div>\n<div>Even that kind of stability defined as simply lack of change is not always associated with maximum diversity. At least, in temperate zone, maximum diversity often found in mid-successional stages, not the climax community. Once a redwood forest matures, the kinds of species and the number of individuals growing on forest floor are reduced. In general, diversity, by it self, do not ensue complexity. Mathematical model of ecosystem likewise suggested that species diversity does not guarantee stability -- the opposite in fact. A more complicated ecosystem is in general, more likely than a simple system to break down. A fifteen-speed racing bicycle is more likely to break down than a child\'s tricycle.</div>\n<div><br clear="none"/></div>\n<div>Ecologists are more interest to know what factor contribute to the resilience of community because climax communities all over the world are being severely damaged or destroyed by human activities. The destruction caused by volcanic explosion of Mount St. Helen in the northwestern United States, for example, pales in comparison to the destruction caused by human. We need to know what aspect of community is most important to community\'s resistance to destruction and as well as its recovery.</div>\n<div><br clear="none"/></div>\n<div>Many ecologists now think that the relative long-term stability of climax community come not from the diversity, but from &quot;patchiness&quot; environment, a environment varies from place to place supports more kinds of organisms than the environment that is uniform. A local population going extinct may be replaced by the immigration from adjacent community. </div>\n<div><br clear="none"/></div>\n<div><br clear="none"/></div>\n<div><br clear="none"/></div></en-note>'

The expenditure of energy is essentially a process of budgeting, as finances are budgeted. If all of one&apos;s money is spent on clothes, there may be none left to buy food or go to movies. Similarly, a plant or animal can not squander energy on growing a big body if none would be left over for reproduction, this is the surest way to extinction.</div><div><br clear="none"/></div><div>All organisms therefore, allocate energy to growth, reproduction, maintenance and storage. No choice is involved. This allocation comes as a part of genetic package from parent. Maintenance for a given body design of an organism is relatively constant. Storage is important, but ultimately that energy will be used for maintenance, reproduction, or growth. The energy principal of difference allocation is much like that it be between growth and reproduction.&nbsp;</div></en-note>'
